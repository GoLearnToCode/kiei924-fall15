# First Day Setup: Your Development Environment

You'll have to install three pieces of software in order to get ready for KIEI-924 this quarter.

1. A **Web Browser**. We'll be using Google Chrome. I like Chrome for its fast and consistent performance, and its built-in Developer Tools (we'll be using these a lot).
- A **Code Editor**.  The code editor is a piece of software that is used to create and edit text files. It's like Microsoft Word, but for code files instead of word processing documents. In this class, we'll use a free editor named Atom.
- The **GitHub App**.  _Git_ is a technology that professional developers use to store their code and share it with others. [GitHub](https://www.github.com) is a company that provides a popular hosted Git service. They provide an app for easy access to their service.


**Attention Windows Users!**
 
Make sure that your Windows PC is running Windows 7 or later. **If it isn't, please upgrade before continuing.**

**Attention Mac Users!**

Make sure that your Mac is running Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) or later. **If it isn't, please upgrade before continuing.**


### 1. Download and Install Atom

[Click here to get Atom](http://www.atom.io). Download the installer for your operating system, and run it.

Then read Sections 1 and 2 of the Flight Manual: https://atom.io/docs/v1.3.2/getting-started-why-atom

### 2. Get a Github Account

Sign up for a free Github account at [the Github website](https://github.com/). You'll be using your Github account for lots of things in class – including turning in your homework and tracking your attendance in class – so keep your account information handy at all times.

Once your Github account is created, YOU MUST **enter your Kellogg email address into your public profile**. Do this by going to your settings (the little "cog" icon in the upper right) and entering it in the "Profile" section.

### 3. Download and Install the Github App

https://mac.github.com/

Once installed, run the GitHub app. You'll be asked to enter the Github username and password you've just created, along with your name and email address. Once you've done this, you should be at an empty "Dashboard view", and you're all set.

### 4. Get The Code You'll Need for Week 1

Finally, download the following and unzip it. **Rename the folder (which will probably be called "profile-master") to "profile".** When you're done, you should have a folder called "profile" with the following files in it:

https://github.com/kiei924-chicago/profile/archive/master.zip

    -- profile
       -- index.html
       -- linedpaper.png
       -- style.css
       -- walter.jpg
