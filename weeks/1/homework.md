**1. Setup Your Development Environment**

In case you didn't before the first class, [follow the instructions to install all necessary development tools](/kiei924-winter15-ev/workbook/setup).

# Due Next Thursday by 11:59PM

Practice what we did in class.  You should be able to:

1. Create a new text file named "index.html"
2. Make this page your own. It could your personal profile page, blog, list of recipes, or any other idea you might have.
3. View the page in your browser.
4. The browser tab should display a meaningful title describing what the page is about (e.g. "About Me", "Brian's Recipes", etc.)
5. Sync your code into your GitHub.com account. The repository should be named *(your Github username)*.github.io. For example, my Github username is *eng*, so my repository name for this assignment should be *eng.github.io*. This will automatically make your page available on the public Internet at that address (e.g. http://eng.github.io/).

You should use these elements at least once:

* h1
* p
* ul
* li
* a
* h2
* body
* html
* title
* head
