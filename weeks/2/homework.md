# Due Next Thursday by 11:59PM

Create another page in your username.github.io project. Create links ("a" tags) on both your original page (index.html) and the new page so that you can go back back and forth between the two pages. For instance, you could have a "home page" and a "contact page", or a "resume" and a "blog".

Continue building out your site. Your HTML should include:

- At least one inline and one block element
- At least one list
- At least one table

Style your page using a separate CSS file. Use the following CSS rules at least once:

- border
- color
- font-family
- font-size
- line-height
- margin
- padding
- width
- height
- float

Commit and sync your changes to your Github account no later than 11:59pm on Thursday.
